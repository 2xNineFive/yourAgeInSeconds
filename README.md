This project is a website where users can push a button that will prompt them for their age in years. 

Somehow, I want the user to be able to enter an infinite amount of responses-- and they will receive an infinite amount of responses. 

The initial files are:   index.html , styles.css ,  main.js .

The html file contains a standard doc with one div in the body that houses a button with the text: "Enter Your Age." Rather, the body should contain some type of "prompt-box" that users can type into. 

The css file style should contain the following styles:
The body will be styled in a grid layout with one column and one row. And the "prompt-box" will be centered on both axes. I plan on using fr to make sure that the website is responsive.  

At the moment, the main.js file contains two sections of code. 

The first section of code is the original code and it has been commented out. This program receives a number from the user and then calculates how old that user is in seconds. It also displays that result to the user. 

The second section of code contains a function that I can invoke with different age values. At the moment, the Javascript interpreter is responding with a correct answer, but I am struggling with getting my function to work with the browser. 

Once I get this working, I would like to iterate the project to create a more accurate response for the age. I would like for the "prompt-box" to ask for a birthday and then return an age in seconds up to that exact moment in time. It would be cool if the answer also updates in real time.
